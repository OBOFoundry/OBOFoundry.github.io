## OBO Foundry pre-registration checklist

To be considered for inclusion in the OBO Foundry, an ontology must meet certain requirements, as described in in [the registration process instructions](http://obofoundry.org/docs/Policy_for_OBO_namespace_and_associated_PURL_requests.html) and the [registration review checklist](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/blob/master/docs/RegistrationChecklist.md). To ensure you are aware of some of its key points, please review the checklist below.

You can either check a box by submitted the request first and then using the GitHub interface, or replacing the `- [ ]` by `- [X]` in the following.

- [ ] I have read and understood [the registration process instructions](http://obofoundry.org/docs/Policy_for_OBO_namespace_and_associated_PURL_requests.html) and the [registration checklist](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/blob/master/docs/RegistrationChecklist.md) 
- [ ] There is no other ontology in the OBO Foundry which would be an appropriate place for my terms. If there was, I have contacted the editors, and we decided in mutual agreement that a separate ontology is more appropriate.
- [ ] My ontology has a specific release file with a version IRI and a dc:license annotation, serialised in RDF/XML.
- [ ] I understand that term definitions, while not mandatory, are key to understanding the intentions of a term especially when the ontology is used in curation. I made sure that a reasonable majority of terms in my ontology have definitions, using the [IAO:0000115](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/IAO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000115) property.
- [ ] For every term in my ontology, I checked whether another OBO Foundry ontology has one with the same meaning. If so, I re-used that term directly (not by cross-reference, by directly using the IRI).
- [ ] For all relationship properties (Object and Data Property) I checked whether [RO](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/catalog/RO?iri=http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl%23ObjectProperty) includes an appropriate one. I understand that aligning with RO is an essential part of the overall alignment between OBO ontologies!
- [ ] For the selection of appropriate annotation properties, I looked at [OMO](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/catalog/OMO?iri=http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl%23AnnotationProperty) first. I understand that aligning ontology metadata and term-level metadata is essential for cross-integration of OBO ontologies. 
- [ ] If I was not sure about the meaning of any of the checkboxes above, I have consulted with a member of the OBO Foundry for advice.
- [ ] The requested ID space does not conflict with another ID space found in other registries such as BioPortal and the Bioregistry, see [here](https://obofoundry.org/id-policy) for a complete list.


## Metadata

Please fill in the following metadata record which will be used by the OBO Foundry website. Note that the values shown are just examples, for example `yourfourletterid` could be something like `aism`, `cohm`, `mondo` (it does not have to be four letters). `your_domain_like_for_example_anatomy` could be simply `anatomy`, and the license should be whatever your actual license is. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/edit/master/ontology/amphx.md), but you really only need to fill in the metadata mentioned here.
