$IDSPACE was reviewed by the OBO Foundry Editorial Working Group and found to perform well when measured against accepted OBO Foundry Principles. Consequently, the Editorial WG recommended that $ID be given full member status as OBO Foundry Ontologies. This decision was ratified by the OBO Foundry Operations Committee.

A full copy of the review and response are available at $link

In addition to conducting the reviews, the Editorial Working Group has been working hard to establish a fair and consistent review policy and workflow and to develop additional guidance to ontology editors on how to apply the OBO Foundry Principles.
