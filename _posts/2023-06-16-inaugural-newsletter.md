## Highlights

### The OBO Foundry celebrates its 20-year anniversary

The OBO Foundry, established in 2003, is an international collaborative effort dedicated to developing and promoting high-quality, interoperable ontologies for biology, biomedicine, and related domains. Guided by principles of _openness_, _collaboration_, and _best practices_, the OBO Foundry has played a crucial role in advancing the field of biomedicine. By fostering the creation of ontologies that facilitate data exchange, knowledge discovery, and cooperation, the initiative has significantly contributed to the standardization and integration of ontologies. Its impact is evident in the broad adoption and utilization of its ontologies, which have become indispensable tools in biomedical research and applications. The OBO Foundry has attracted a diverse community of researchers, developers, and users from various biological and biomedical disciplines, reinforcing its mission of advancing data integration and analysis in research and clinical practice.

## Ontologies

In this inaugural edition of the OBO newsletter, we want to remind you of the [procedure for requesting the inclusion of a new ontology in the OBO Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/faq/how-do-i-register-my-ontology.html):

1. Clearly define the ontology's purpose and scope.
2. Review [OBO Foundry Principles](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html) for alignment.
3. Check existing ontologies to avoid duplication.
4. Contact the OBO Foundry community to express interest and seek feedback.
5. Develop the ontology based on discussions and best practices.
6. Submit the ontology for review and feedback.
7. If accepted, add to the website and ensure ongoing maintenance. For detailed instructions, refer to the official documentation or engage with the OBO Foundry community.

We evaluate new ontologies for possible inclusion in the  OBO Foundry on an ongoing basis. These carefully reviewed and curated ontologies cover different biomedical domains, enhancing data integration and collaboration within the community.

The list of topics for the 186 active ontologies accepted by the [OBO community](http://obofoundry.org/) as of 2023 include agriculture, anatomy and development, biological systems, chemistry and biochemistry, diet, metabolomics, and nutrition, environment, health, information, information technology, investigations, microbiology, organisms, phenotype, and simulation. These diverse topics highlight the broad scope of ontologies developed and accepted by the OBO community, contributing to improvements in data integration and knowledge discovery in the biomedical domain.

Recently accepted ontologies include:

* [Alzheimer's Disease Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ado.html)
* [Next Generation Biobanking Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/ngbo.html)
* [Vertebrate Breed Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/vbo.html)

### Spotlight on Ontologies

In every newsletter, we would like to highlight one or two ontologies from the OBO Foundry family to promote their use. Today, we introduce the [Core Ontology for Biology and Biomedicine (COB)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/cob.html) and the [OBO Metadata Ontology (OMO)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/omo.html), two ontologies fundamental to the vision of OBO interoperability.

* [Core Ontology for Biology and Biomedicine (COB):](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/cob.html) An upper level ontology for the domain of Biology and Biomedicine. The OBO community has produced a large number of ontologies that cover biological and biomedical entities from anatomy, chemistry, assays and chemicals to diseases and phenotypes. While many ontologies have aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), we have been lacking an easy to understand top-level that can be used by domain experts. The goal of COB is to organize the core types of biological entities into a small top level ontology, serving as an upper layer for biological data integration and querying. Establishing a basic community-wide agreement on the semantics of these core entities is a difficult task, but central for a core vision of OBO: decentralized development of interoperable ontologies. To contribute to the discussion, use the [COB issue tracker](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/COB/issues).
* [OBO Metadata Ontology (OMO)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/omo.html): The OBO Metadata Ontology (OMO) defines all the standard properties used by OBO ontologies for both on ontology and term level. The goal of OMO is complementary to that of COB: to ensure that OBO wide, people that need to annotate metadata such as synonyms, contributors, term tracker items and ontology licenses do so using the exact same property, thereby facilitating interoperability. OMO is governed by the community consensus, which means that anyone can suggest changes and editions and put them to a vote. To propose new properties for inclusion, please use the [OMO issue tracker](https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/ontology-metadata).

## Members and Volunteers

Our vibrant community of [OBO Foundry members and volunteers](http://obofoundry.org/docs/Membership.html) is the driving force behind our success. Comprising professionals from different fields, they contribute their time and expertise to develop and assess high-quality ontologies and advance principles and best practices for interoperable ontologies. Their collaborative efforts support data integration, knowledge discovery, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

OBO is led by a volunteer team consisting of ontology maintainers and stakeholders (the ‘OBO operations committee’). This team performs multiple duties, including maintaining the site, stewarding the principles, and curating ontology metadata. The committee is divided into various subgroups which are concerned with the following problems:

* The [Technical Working Group](https://obofoundry.org/docs/TechnicalWG.html) is involved in maintaining the technical infrastructure for the OBO Foundry. This includes establishment of policies to be implemented in common tools, website maintenance, calls, etc.
* The [Editorial Working Group](https://obofoundry.org/docs/EditorialWG.html) is involved in reviewing OBO Foundry ontologies and setting policies. Primary tasks are to conduct reviews, as well as all activities that enable that process, such as tool building for automated validation, website maintenance of the review results, or leading calls and taking notes.
* The [OBO Foundry Outreach Working Group](https://obofoundry.org/docs/OutreachWG.html) is involved in public relations for the OBO Foundry. This includes monitoring and following up discussions on mailing lists, preparing documentation and educational materials, and presenting OBO Foundry activities at workshops, conferences, or other venues.
* The [OBO Academy](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/) is a community run education resource concerned with documenting many best practices that go beyond OBO Principles, and provide extensive training materials for all the technology developed and supported by the technical working group.

Recently, the OBO Operations Committee introduced a more refined role system in the OBO Foundry which clearly documents the work that needs to be performed on an ongoing basis. The new [roles and their responsibilities are listed on the website](https://obofoundry.org/roles/overview).

By collaborating across these different areas and pulling together volunteers from a wide range of expertise, the OBO operations committee actively supports the vision of the OBO Foundry. The Standard Operating Procedure to become a member of the committee (still in development) is [documented here](https://obofoundry.org/docs/NewOBOFC.html). Reach out on Slack (obo-community channel) or via our [obo-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/obo-discuss) if you are interested in joining.

### New Volunteers

In this section we introduce the volunteers that recently joined the OBO Operations Committee. [Mathias Brochhausen](https://github.com/mbrochhausen) recently rejoined the OBO Operations Committee, after a period of absence. Welcome back Mathias!

## Decisions Made and Important Updates

### Decisions regarding changes to OBO principles

OBO Foundry publishes a set of [principles](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html) that capture ontology best practices and that are used to assess new ontologies that wish to be included. We continuously review, refine, and clarify our principles to ensure that they support our commitment to ontological excellence. Below are some recent updates.

* NEW Principle 13 (Notification): Announcing major changes to stakeholders ahead of release. [Principle 13](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-013-notification.html) of the OBO Foundry emphasizes the importance of announcing significant changes to relevant stakeholders and collaborators before the ontology's release. This proactive notification allows stakeholders to provide input on upcoming changes and update any dependencies affected by those changes.
* NEW Recommendation that ontology developers include guidelines and instructions for making contributions to ontology terms and discussions. Text to this effect has been added to [Principle 8](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-008-documented.html) (Documentation), [Principle 10](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-010-collaboration.html) (Commitment to Collaboration), and [Principle 20](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-020-responsiveness.html) (Responsiveness).
* NEW Table of Contents added to principles pages. This is to aid users in finding information of interest.
* CLARIFICATION The OBO Foundry has made explicit the (previously implied) requirement for English language definitions ([Principle 6](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-006-textual-definitions.html)). This was done both for pragmatic reasons (e.g., to enable reviews of new ontologies), and to match the similar requirement for English language labels and other fields ([Principle 12](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-012-naming-conventions.html)). Discussions on how best to use/specify other languages is ongoing.

### Updates from the technical working group

* On the 3rd June, we provisionally activated https support for our ontology PURLs. This means that from now on, you can access OMO not only through [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/omo.owl](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/omo.owl), but also [https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/omo.owl](https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/omo.owl)! Follow the discussion [here](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/issues/705). Note that this **_does not extend to the use of term identifiers_**. While this identifier now resolves: [https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMO_0002000](https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMO_0002000), you MUST NOT use https IRIs in your ontology, because [https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMO_0002000](https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMO_0002000) and [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMO_0002000](https://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OMO_0002000) are fundamentally different things on RDF level.
* New versions of ROBOT ([1.9.4](https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/tag/v1.9.4)) and the Ontology Development Kit (ODK, [1.4.1](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/releases/tag/v1.4.1)) were made available on the 23rd May 2023. ROBOT and ODK are two tools extensively supported by the OBO Technical Working Group.

## Ongoing Discussions

Here, we list some of the more important discussions happening around the OBO-sphere:

* The [definition of a "disease" class in COB](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/COB/pull/226) is, not surprisingly, one of the hardest problems to get agreement on. The discussion has stalled, and needs to be re-invigorated.
* [What should happen on 01.01.2024 when passing the Dashboard becomes mandatory?](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2360) Get involved in the discussion!
* Some of us would like to visually separate permanently defective (e.g. unparseable, inconsistent) ontologies from the rest. [Join the discussion](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2348).
* [We are discussing the Standard Operating Procedure for activating a new OBO Principle](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2273)!
* We are discussing the [introduction of a new ontology status, unresponsive, for ontologies that do not respond to any of the regular communication channels](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2255).

## New Version of Protégé is now available

[Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) is a popular open source ontology editor used by many ontology developers within and beyond the OBO Foundry. A new  release of Protégé 5.6.2 is now available. You can download it from: [https://github.com/protegeproject/protege-distribution/releases/tag/protege-5.6.2](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege-distribution/releases/tag/protege-5.6.2). Note that it is recommended that all OBO Foundry ontology editors use this latest version of Protégé for editing.

This version primarily addresses a bug affecting macOS users who could not save files due to the absence of the file-saving dialog ([ticket #1106](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege/issues/1106)).

Rest assured, the new release maintains compatibility with the OWL API 4.5.25, ensuring a seamless upgrade without any serialization issues. The Protege developers appreciate your feedback to help identify bugs, which allows improvements to Protege for all users.  Bugs and feature requests can be reported here: [https://github.com/protegeproject/protege/issues](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege/issues) or via the [Protege Slack channel](https://obo-communitygroup.slack.com/archives/C01BFAZPQ86) in the OBO Foundry workspace.

Protege is now developed under a community contribution model. Much gratitude goes to [Damien Goutte-Gattat](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6095-8718) and [Huseyin Kir](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3315-2794) for their work to help deliver this new release and implement these fixes.

## Ways to be part of the OBO Foundry community

There are many ways to be part of the OBO Foundry community, beyond [using our website to find ontologies of interest](https://obofoundry.org). For example:

* Join the [obo-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/obo-discuss) (low-traffic, no spam)
* If you are interested in the technical aspects, you can also join the [obo-tools mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!members/obo-tools)
* Join the conversation in our [Slack workspace](https://obo-communitygroup.slack.com/archives/C01DP18L5GW)
* Use our public [issue tracker](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues) to report a problem you discovered on obofoundry.org or request a new feature
    * Note that most issues relating to individual ontologies (e.g., a request to add a new term) should be added to the issue tracker for the specific ontology
* Propose a fix to an issue you see on our issue tracker (this is done via a GitHub Pull Request, which will be checked and approved by someone in the Foundry). Since all of [our code is publicly readable](https://github.com/OBOFoundry), you may be able to pinpoint where a bug fix needs to go.
* [Request that your ontology be considered for inclusion in the Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/faq/how-do-i-register-my-ontology.html)
* If you want to take your contributions to OBO Foundry to the next level, you can [nominate yourself to be considered for the OBO Operations Committee](https://obofoundry.org/docs/NewOBOFC.html). There are various roles in which you can contribute, including assisting with the production of this newsletter.
