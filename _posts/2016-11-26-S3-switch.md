summary: "The URL for central OBO builds has changed from berkeleybop.org/ontologies to ontologies.berkeleybop.org"

---

All ontologies in the OBO library have a permanent URL (PURL) that
always resolves to the OWL for the ontology (most ontologies have a
PURL that resolves to an OBO Format version too). For example:

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/pato.owl
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/pato.obo

Additionally, some ontologies may have additional artefacts/products
such as slims available within their namespace.

These purls should always be used to reference the
ontology. Maintainers of ontologies have the option of deciding what
their PURL resolves to. Many choose to resolve to the [central OBO
build
URLs](http://obofoundry.org/faq/what-is-the-build-field).

Historically these have always resolved to
http://berkeleybop.org/ontologies/ -- we have recently changed this to
http://ontologies.berkeleybop.org

Please note this should not affect you if you are a consumer of
ontologies - you should always use the PURL directly.

(although hopefully ontologies should now resolve faster, as we are
using Amazon S3 plus CloudFront).

If you are a providers of ontologies and you have made use of the
central OBO build, then your PURLs have been switched to use the new scheme as part of [this pull request](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/pull/262).
