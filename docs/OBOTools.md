# OBO Tools

## Development Tools

### [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/)

ROBOT (ROBOT is an OBO Tool) is a command line tool to automate ontology workflows. It includes a series of commands that can be used manually or integrated in automated processes to develop and release ontologies.

### [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit)

The ODK is a tool to initialize a new ontology repository. The template includes a structured directory, a Makefile with automated release workflows, continuous integration testing, and full documentation.

### [Onto-Animals](http://www.hegroup.org/ontozoo/)

The Onto-Animal tools support efficient integrated ontology development. These tools can be used together to extract external ontology terms, compare ontologies, edit ontology terms, query and visualize ontologies, and more.

### [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)

Protégé is an ontology editing environment for OWL ontologies. It allows developers to visualize the ontology hierarchy, add and edit ontology terms, reason over the ontology, and more.

## Browsers

### [OntoBee](http://www.ontobee.org/)

OntoBee is part of the Onto-Animal tool collection. Users can search all available ontologies (listed on the home page) and browse pages with detailed descriptions of individiual terms. OntoBee is the default server for most OBO Foundry ontology IRIs.

### [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index)

OLS contains the most up-to-date versions of biomedical ontologies. Users can search for terms across all ontologies, or individual ontologies, as well as view term hierarchies. OLS also has an API so that ontologies can be browsed programmatically.

### [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/)

BioPortal contains over 700 biomedical ontologies, including the OBO Foundry ontologies. Like the other browsers, users can search for terms or browse individual ontologies. BioPortal also provides a variety of tools to aid in increasing ontology interoperability.

### [AberOWL](http://aber-owl.net/)

AberOWL is a repository of biological ontologies and access to reasoned versions of those ontologies. Ontolgies can be browsed by term labels or queried by Manchester OWL syntax statements.
