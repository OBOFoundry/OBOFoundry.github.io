#Â My ontology is not ready for OBO Foundry, can I reserve a prefix anyway?

If your ontology is not eligible for inclusion in the OBO Foundry you can not directly reserve a prefix (Ontology ID) in the OBO Foundry.
However, if you want to make sure that no one uses your prefix, you can [register your prefix at the Bioregistry](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/new/choose).
The updated [OBO policy on IDs](https://obofoundry.org/id-policy) ensures that new prefix requests must not clash with existing prefixes registered at the Bioregistry.

_Note_: when making a OBO Foundry New Ontology Request which conflicts with a previously registered prefix at one of the registries listed by the [OBO policy on IDs](https://obofoundry.org/id-policy), you will be asked to provide evidence that the submitted ontology and the previously submitted prefix (i.e. at the Bioregistry) indeed refer to the same resource.
