## Ontology Development Guidelines

### Releases

    * Keep your edit file (the file you change on a regular basis) and your release files strictly separate
    * Imports should be merged into the main release file

### Collaboration

    * Tag your GitHub repository with the obofoundry tag so that people can find it: https://github.com/topics/obofoundry


## Standardization Guidelines

### Social

SOCIAL External axioms #1443 & #1991 | possible new "what to do with terms" principle (can be p14)

### Communication

COMMUNICATION Ontology subsets documentation #466
COMMUNICATION Referring to taxa not in NCBITaxon #434
COMMUNICATION Document how to add logo #72
COMMUNICATION Short ontology descriptions #1968
COMMUNICATION Documentation for license #1840

### Content

CONTENT Discourage BFO shadow classes #1539
CONTENT? Ignoring NCIT (no issue, but has come up that NCIT is not well-formed enough to be a concern re: things like overlap)
METADATA Term adoption #2330 (also #2324)

### Technical




Not yet classified:

    Every ontology SHOULD provide a base
    Every ontology primary release MUST be consistent and coherent
    Every ontology MUST be coherent when classified together with RO, BFO, and COB
    Every ontology SHOULD be coherent when classified together with all its base-dependencies
