## Ontology Development Guidelines

### Releases

    * Keep your edit file (the file you change on a regular basis) and your release files strictly separate
    * Imports should be merged into the main release file

### Collaboration

    * Tag your GitHub repository with the obofoundry tag so that people can find it: https://github.com/topics/obofoundry
