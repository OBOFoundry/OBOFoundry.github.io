The [OBO Foundry dashboard](https://dashboard.obofoundry.org/) checks ontologies for adherence to OBO Foundry principles. The Dashboard Manager's jobs are:
1. Update the dashboard once per month
1. Fix important bugs in OBO-Dashboard if they come up (should be rare)
1. Work with OBO Ops to find people who can update the dashboard code when new principles are added or existing ones are changed.
