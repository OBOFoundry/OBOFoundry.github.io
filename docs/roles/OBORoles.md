# OBO Foundry Roles

OBO Foundry Roles are designed to manage a single problem space of the day-to-day activities of the OBO Foundry. 
This document is describes the common duties for all roles, as well as some general SOPs for recruiting for and retiring from roles.

## General SOPs

- The minimal duration of an appointment to a role is 1 year. The last OBO Operations Committee call every year should be used for reviewing role assignments.
- New volunteers should be given a chance to apply for roles: they are also a vehicle to get people involved with OBO Foundry work.
- Before assigning a new individual to a role, they should read this document, and all document pertaining their own role, and actively 
  agree they understand the involved duties and intend to fulfill them to the best of their ability.
- Any OBO Operations Committee member may suggest to appoint or remove from appointment any individual they see fit for a role.
- Each candidate must submit an application for a role to the OBO Operations Committee outlining their motivation for taking on the role as well as 
  describing the skillsets they believe make themselves suitable for performing the role.
- The OBO Operations Committee reviews all such applications. Decisions for appointing a member of the community to a role should be unanimous. 
  In the rare case of a conflict on accepting an appoinment, a vote may be called. 
  The vote must not have not more than 30% of the votes against the appointment.
- In the rare event an individual appointed for a role is suggested to be removed (see above), a vote must be called to enact the removal. 
  At least 70% of the current OBO Operations Committee members need to be in favour of removing the person from the appointment. This does not
  remove the person as a member of the OBO Operations Committee, but certain priviliges (Google Admin rights, GitHub Maintainer rights) may be re-voked
  at the discretion of the Working Group managing the role.


## Common duties/responsibilities for all roles

- Role-holders should announce extended absences (more than 1 month) so that role can be covered by another OBO Foundry Operations team member. 
  Absences or desire to retire should be (1) reported to the respective OBO Working Group Liaison (usually the 
  OBO Foundry Committee Technical Working Group Liason) and (2) be announced in an email to the OBO Operations Commitee mailing list.
- All role holders must manage themselves _pro-actively_: there is no line management structure. It is therefore critical that the role holder
  take their duties responsibly.
