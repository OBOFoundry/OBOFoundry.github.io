title: TWG Ops Liaison
---

The TWG Ops Liaison is a Technical Working Group (TWG) representative who serves as a liaison to the OBO Foundry Operations Committee (OFOC).

Major responsibilities:
1. Report TWG progress at OFOC calls
- Monitor PURL, Dashboard, COB, OMO and GitHub repos for PRs and new issues
- Collect those issues for every meeting in short digestible report (links are fine, no details needed unless pertinent)
- Report those issues during OFOC calls
2. Serve as a first point of contact for OFOC and OBO Community for technical Q/A
- In Slack and GitHub issue tracker, be responsive to user requests relating to OFOC activities (PURL, dashboard, principles, OMO, COB) and direct them to the right channels
- Help connect OFOC members who need technical help with the right TWG members
3. Mark relevant GitHub issues for discussion during OFOC call
- When a new GitHub issue or PR seems to need OFOC attention, label "attn: OFOC label" a few days before the next OFOC call
- When a GitHub issue has been discussed during an OFOC call, make sure a comment to that end is added to that issue and the label removed
4. Summarise TWG activities to OBO Newsletter steward
- Provide a list of major activities to the newsletter steward for inclusion in the newsletter when requested, or when activities of note happen

Note that the TWG Liaison does not have to be the TWG chair; therefore, the TWG Liaison doesn't need to have technical expertise. (The TWG doesn't currently have a dedicated chair because it doesn't have a regular meeting schedule.)
