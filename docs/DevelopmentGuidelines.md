---

### Technical

- Ontology merging metadata [#1548](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1548)

### Content


### Releases

- (DISCUSS) Keep your edit file (the file you change on a regular basis) and your release files strictly separate
- (DISCUSS. Also check what is considered the main release file. Reasoned?) Imports should be merged into the main release file

### Social

- (DISCUSS) Tag your GitHub repository with the obofoundry tag so that people can find it: https://github.com/topics/obofoundry

### Communication

- Publications metadata [#1671](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1671)
- Short ontology descriptions [#1968](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1968)   (ONLY INCLUDE IF CHANGING PAGE NAME)
