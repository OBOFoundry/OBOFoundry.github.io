## Meeting calendar

The OBO Foundry calendar is publicly available to view at http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cW8yM2Q3NDliajh0ZGwwb2VlNnRhdnBoc3NAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ. Please see below for how to add it to your own calendar.
Everybody can see it; however only a subset of people can edit it. Maintenance of the calendar is done on a per request basis, and only approved people have editing rights to prevent spamming.

This calendar contains event such as
(1) OBO meetings, for example the regular OBI developer call or the ad-hoc OGMS discussion on diagnosis
(2) events of interest to the community: the NCBO webinars, or the ontolog sessions
(3) meetings and workshops, such as ICBO, NCBO events etc. Deadlines would be acceptable (e.g. September 5th, deadline for tutorial proposal for some conference)

Personal events are not appropriate for this calendar (e.g. Z on vacation) and adding those will result in editing rights being revoked.
