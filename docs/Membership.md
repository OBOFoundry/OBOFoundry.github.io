# Introduction #

The OBO Foundry Operations Committee discusses, oversees, and ensures the completion of the fundamental day-to-day activities of the Foundry. The Committee is composed of three working groups. Anyone who is active in a working group (active being based on both attendance at WG meetings and actual work done for working groups) is considered a member of the Operations Committee.

# Working Groups #

There are currently three working groups:
- [Editorial Working Group](EditorialWG.html) 
- [Technical Working Group](TechnicalWG.html)
- [Outreach Working Group](OutreachWG.html)
