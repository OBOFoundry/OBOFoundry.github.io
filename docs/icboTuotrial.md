# ICBO Tutorial - A How-To Guide to Create, Manage, and Release an OBO Ontology #

**Organizers:** [Chris Mungall](http://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/chris-mungall/), [Becky (Tauber) Jackson](https://github.com/rctauber), [James Overton](http://james.overton.ca/), [Nicole Vasilevsky](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/nicole-vasilevsky/AFE02EDDEA27ECE3D94EFA42F7295044)  
**When:** July 30 or 31, 2019 (Final date TBD)  
**Where:** [ICBO 2019](https://sites.google.com/view/icbo2019/home?authuser=0), Buffalo, NY  

## Overview ##
Numerous tools exist for building, managing and releasing ontologies. This tutorial aims to introduce participants
to OBO Foundry best practices and provide hands on training for specific ontology development tools. As an
outcome of this tutorial, participants will have an increased understanding of best practices for ontology
development and will learn how to use various ontology development tools, for use in contributing to community
ontologies.

This first half of the workshop is targeted towards beginner-level ontology developers to learn basics about
community ontology development, and using the ontology editing tool, Protege. The second half of the workshop
is targeted towards broader skill levels, and will provides an opportunity for participants to learn to use the latest
tools to support improved workflows, ontology management, and provenance and attribution.

## Topics to be covered ##

1. **Introduction to the OBO Foundry, OWL, and OWL reasoning.** We will introduce participants to the
foundations and principles of the [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/), a community of ontology
developers who are committed to a shared set of principles and practices, with the goal of building
scientifically accurate, logical and interoperable ontologies. Additionally, we will discuss tips and
strategies for community ontology development.
2. **Ontology lookup services**: We will provide an overview of various ontology lookup services, such as
the [Ontology Lookup Service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) from EBI, and NCBI [BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/).
3. **Tools and workflows for ontology development and release.** Standard workflows exist in the OBO
Foundry for managing various portions of an ontology project. We will provide an interactive tutorial to
guide participants through the process of creation and releasing an ontology in a standardized way. This
will include hands on instruction on the basics of various ontology-editing tools. Protégé is a free, open
source, widely used ontology editing software application. We will provide hands on training
introducing the basic functionality of the Protege interface. The [Ontology Development Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) contains workflows to create a new ontology
(or retrofit an existing ontology) and manage the release process using OBO Foundry best practices.
[ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org) is an ontology editing tool that uses simple command line tools.
4. **Knowtation**: James Overton will introduce the new language and tool, [Knotation](https://knotation.org).
