This page describes the process for reviewing, updating, and creating [OBO Foundry Principles](http://obofoundry.github.io/principles/fp-000-summary.html).

  * Discuss the principle on working group call
  * Write up proposed revisions as a GitHub issue (not a pull request)
  * Inform the Editorial WG via email that the ticket needs discussion (if it doesnâ€™t happen automatically)
  * Two-week commenting period on GitHub issue tracker
  * Make any incremental improvements on the tracker
  * When the Editorial WG agrees on a final version, discuss on an Operations Committee call or via the issue  tracke
  * Make a pull request
  * Two-week commenting period on the pull request
  * Upload final changes to OBO Foundry web site for public viewing.

The need for a new principle can arise when an existing principle tries to cover too much and requires splitting, or as new needs arise within the community.
