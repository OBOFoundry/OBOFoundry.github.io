To add an ontology project to the OBO Foundry website, follow the [OBOPURLDomain](OBOPURLDomain.md) instructions.

The http://obofoundry.org website is hosted by [Berkeley BOP](http://berkeleybop.org). The content and code for generating the site are in the CVS repository of the "obo" SourceForge project: http://obo.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/obo/obo/website/. See the `htdocs` directory for the main HTML pages. A script hosted by Chris Mungall will automatically update the site every night at midnight using the latest content from CVS.

To make changes you will need credentials for the "obo" project on SourceForge and a CVS client program. SourceForge instructions are here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/CVS
