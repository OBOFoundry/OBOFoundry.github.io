### New Ontology Requests (NOR) 

1. When receiving a new ontology request (NOR), the OBO dashboard administrator should thank the submitter for their submission.
1. The OBO dashboard administrator adds the new submission to the NOR dashboard, which is deployed at https://obofoundry.github.io/obo-nor.github.io/
1. After the dashboard is run, the OBO dashboard administrator informs the submitter about the need to fix the issues revealed by the dashboard, noting this is not part of the review itself, just a precursor, and that upon completion, a liaison will be assigned.
1. At the next OBO operations call, a liaison is selected to be responsible for the issue. This liaison becomes familiar with the new ontology and rallies the appropriate people to provide feedback.
1. At the next OBO operations call after that one, the liaison presents the NOR to the OBO operations committee and answers questions. In most cases, the information provided will be sufficient to either grant or refuse the prefix request. In some cases, the OBO operations committee may choose to postpone their decision to require some clarification and fixes from the submitter.
