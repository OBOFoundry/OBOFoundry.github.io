The OBO Foundry Operations Committee aims to facilitate the flow of operations within the OBO Foundry, in collaboration with the OBO Foundry Coordinating Editors and external invited experts. Such operations include, but are not limited to, establishment of policies, review of resources, outreach and education.

## Organization of the OBO Foundry Operations Committee

To best perform those activities, the OBO Foundry Operations Committee is divided into working groups. The working groups are self-organized and membership is contingent upon active participation. All active members are required to take on tasks to maintain active standing. Policies are proposed and voted upon by active members. A process for policy approval will be formalized.

Current working groups include:

- **OBO Foundry Editorial working group**

The [OBO Foundry Editorial working group](EditorialWG.md) is involved in reviewing OBO Foundry ontologies and policy setting. Primary tasks are to conduct reviews, but also include all activities that enable that process, such as tool building for automated validation, website maintenance of the review results, or leading calls and taking notes.

- **OBO Foundry Technical working group**

The [OBO Foundry Technical working group](TechnicalWG.md) is involved in maintaining the technical infrastructure for the OBO Foundry. This includes establishment of policies to be implemented in common tools, website maintenance, calls, etc.

- **OBO Foundry Outreach working group**

The [OBO Foundry Outreach working group](OutreachWG.md) is involved in public relations for the OBO Foundry. This includes monitoring and following up discussions on mailing lists, preparing documentation and educational materials, and presenting OBO Foundry activities at workshops, conferences, or other venues.
