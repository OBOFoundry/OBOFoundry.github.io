### Content

CONTENT Discourage BFO shadow classes [#1539](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1539)
CONTENT? Ignoring NCIT (no issue, but has come up that NCIT is not well-formed enough to be a concern re: things like overlap)
METADATA Term adoption [#2330](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2330) and [#2324](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2324)

### Technical




Not yet classified:

    Every ontology SHOULD provide a base
    Every ontology primary release MUST be consistent and coherent
    Every ontology MUST be coherent when classified together with RO, BFO, and COB
    Every ontology SHOULD be coherent when classified together with all its base-dependencies
