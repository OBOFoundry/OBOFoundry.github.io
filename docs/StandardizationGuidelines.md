title: Ontology Standardization Guidelines
---

### Technical

- Every ontology MUST be coherent when classified together with RO, BFO, and COB
- Every ontology SHOULD be coherent when classified together with all its base-dependencies
- Standardizing how imported ontologies are noted [#424](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/424)
- Ontology metadata requirements [#1365](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1365)
- Ontology root terms annotation [#2149](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2149)
- Language tags [#479](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/479)

### Content

- Discourage BFO shadow classes [#1539](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1539)
- Ignoring NCIT (no issue, but has come up that NCIT is not well-formed enough to be a concern re: things like overlap)
- Term adoption [#2330](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2330) and [#2324](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2324)
- Standardized xref prefixes in ontologies [#525](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/525)
- Referring to taxa not in NCBITaxon [#434](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/434)
- Use standard synonym types [#2450](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/2450)

### Releases

- Every ontology SHOULD provide a base
- Every ontology primary release MUST be consistent and coherent
