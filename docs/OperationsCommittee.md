[Members](Membership.html) of the OBO Foundry Operations Committee aim to improve the flow of operations and make things happen within the [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org). Such operations include, but are not limited to, establishment of policies, review of resources, outreach and education.

- The [Editorial Working Group](EditorialWG.html) is involved in reviewing OBO Foundry ontologies and setting policies. Primary tasks are to conduct reviews, as well as all activities that enable that process, such as tool building for automated validation, website maintenance of the review results, or leading calls and taking notes.

- The [Technical Working Group](TechnicalWG.html) is involved in maintaining the technical infrastructure for the OBO Foundry. This includes establishment of policies to be implemented in common tools, website maintenance, calls, etc.

- The [Outreach Working Group](OutreachWG.html) is involved in public relations for the OBO Foundry. This includes monitoring and following up discussions on mailing lists, preparing documentation and educational materials, and presenting OBO Foundry activities at workshops, conferences, or other venues.
