<h3>Are the ontologies in the OBO Foundry available only in OBO format?</h3>
<p>
No!  
<a href="http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/OboInOwl:Main_Page">Here is a definition of the OBO language in terms of
OWL semantics</a>.
You can download any OBO ontology in various formats--including OWL--<a href="http://www.berkeleybop.org/ontologies">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Is there a tool that will let me create or edit OBO
ontologies?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.oboedit.org/">OBO-Edit</a>, an open source Java
tool, offers a convenient visual interface for creating, editing, and browsing ontologies.
It was initially created to work on OBO-format ontologies, but is currently
being extended to handle other ontology formats, such as OWL.
</p>

	<h3>How should we resolve conflicts when ontologies overlap?</h3>
	<p>
	  Make every attempt to resolve inconsistencies and merge the
	  ontologies. Tools are available for aiding this process
	  (such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090924102802/http://www.berkeleybop.org:80/obol/">OBOL</a>
	  and <a
	  href="http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Prompt">Prompt</a>)
	  and the community can be used to help clarify best
	  practices.

	  Also, face-to-face meetings can helpful to resolve details
	  that cannot be covered through email.
