Details

The original formulation of this principle requires some modifications.
The pattern laid down in the RO paper does not make sense for OBO and
OWL ontologies, which use instance level relations, not type level
relations. See [this
thread](http://groups.google.com/group/obo-relations/browse_thread/thread/29fc616eb570f7dc/fc0647f190b5f178).
