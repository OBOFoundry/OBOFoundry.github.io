Briefly, some important things to remember:

 * use rdfs:label for the primary label
 * include exactly one rdfs:label for every declared entity (e.g. class, property)
 * write labels, synonyms, etc as if writing in plain English text. ie use spaces to separate words, only capitalize proper names (e.g. Parkinson disease). Do not use CamelCase, do_not_use_underscores
 * spell out abbreviations. Abbreviations can be included as a separate property.
 * make the primary labels to be as unambiguous as possible. Remember, your ontology may be used in a different context than that for which it was originally intended. Remember also of course that the label should be unambiguous without looking at parent terms
 * labels should be unique within an ontology
 * use the IAO property 'obo foundry unique label' [http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000589](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000589) to declare a pan-OBO unique label if required
