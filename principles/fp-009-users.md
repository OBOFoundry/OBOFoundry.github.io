Summary
-------

The ontology developers should document that the ontology is used by
multiple independent people or organizations.

[This check is automatically validated.](checks/fp_009)

Purpose
-------

This principle aims to ensure that the ontology tackles a relevant
scientific area and does so in a usable and sustainable fashion.

Recommendation
-------
It is important to be able to illustrate usage outside
of the immediate circle of ontology developers and stakeholders. An
ontology that has not been used by other than the developer(s) is not
yet ready for review. Note that the ontology can still be listed in
other ontology portals such as the OBO Library while publicising your
resource in appropriate channels and searching for users with needs you
can meet.

Implementation
--------------

The ontology developers should provide links/citations to evidence of
use (publication, external ontology; see examples below) as input to the
review process.

Examples
--------

-   Use of the target ontology's term IRIs in other ontologies. This can
    be evidenced by linking to the other ontology that uses an ontology
    term IRI from this ontology

-   Imports in other ontologies, again, evidenced through a link to the
    importing ontology

-   A documentation page with links to databases using the ontology for
    annotation

-   Use in semantic web projects (e.g., Open PHACTS usage)

-   Use in diverse software applications, including text mining or
    analysis pipelines

-   Publications showing the ontology being used in research (evidenced
    by citation details for the publications; if behind paywall it may
    be necessary to provide a PDF for the paper)

-   Citations to the ontology publication(s); such citations are only
    relevant if the authors indicate actual use of the cited ontology
    within some community (mere mention of the existence is not enough
    to warrant inclusion)

-   Documentation of requests from multiple users, e.g., via an issue
    tracker (provide a link to the issue tracker online)

-   Use of the terms from the ontology to structure or annotate
    experimental or derived data (e.g. GOA; provide details of how to
    review the annotations)

Counter-Examples
----------------

Mere mention of the existence of an ontology in a publication is not
enough to count as evidence of usage

Criteria for Review
-------------------

To pass review, the ontology developers must demonstrate at least three
external users. External users are defined either as researchers not
significantly overlapping in personnel with the developers or three
independent groups with three independent artefacts (db, etc) that use
the ontology.
