title: Scope (principle 5)
---


NOTE
-------
The wording of this principle is still in progress, with some issues still to be addressed (see Issues To Be Addressed below).

Summary
-------
The scope of an ontology is the extent of the domain or subject matter it intends to cover. The ontology must have a clearly specified scope and content that adheres to that scope.

Purpose
-------
An in-scope ontology prevents overlaps between ontologies (duplication of terms), facilitates user searches for specific content, and enables quick selection of ontologies of interest, yet still allows for new terms to be created via combination of existing terms (cross-products).

Recommendations and Requirements
-------
Ideally the scope should be fairly narrow. Required terms that are out of scope should be imported from the appropriate ontology.

Implementation
-------
The domain (scope) covered by the ontology should be clearly stated. The statement should be brief and free of jargon; a few sentences should suffice. The content of the ontology should stay within the confines of the stated scope.

Examples
--------

Counter-Examples
----------------

Issues To Be Addressed (partial list):
-------
1.Would like a metadata tag in the ontology itself for this. TBD.

2.Possible need for controlled vocabulary for scope/domain (for example: Anatomy, Upper Level Ontology, Disease, Phenotype, Applicable taxonomy)

## Criteria for Review
A scope (‘domain’) MUST be declared in the registry data.
