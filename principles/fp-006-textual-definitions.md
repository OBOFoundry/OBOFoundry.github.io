Principle Name
--------------

textual definitions

Details
-------

textual definitions (SOP) for a substantial and representative fraction,
plus equivalent formal definitions (for at least a substantial number of
terms). For terms lacking textual definitions, there should be evidence
of implementation of a strategy to provide definitions for all remaining
undefined terms.

Text definitions should be unique (i.e. no two terms should share a
definition)

Date Accepted
-------------

-   original principle, modified

Clarifications required
-----------------------

-   What percentage of terms defined is acceptable?
-   Need clarification on
    -   text definitions
    -   text definitions written in formal style / genus differentia
    -   computable definitions (i.e. equivalence axioms /
        cross-products)

History
-------

### Original Formulation

```
 The ontologies include textual definitions for all terms.

Many biological and medical terms may be ambiguous, so terms should be
defined so that their precise meaning within the context of a particular
ontology is clear to a human reader.
