## [Responsiveness](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-020-responsiveness.html) Automated Check

Discussion on this check can be [found here](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/959).

### Requirements

1. The ontology **must** have a tracker.

### Fixes

First, read the [FAQ](http://obofoundry.github.io/faq/how-do-i-edit-metadata.html) on how to edit the metadata for your ontology.

#### Adding a Tracker

If you do not already have a version control repository that has an [Issues Tracker](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues), create one. We recommend creating a [GitHub Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo). To do this, you will need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one.

Once you have a version control repository, add the following to your [metadata file](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/tree/master/ontology) (replacing with the link to your repository's issue tracker):

```
tracker: https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/issues
```

### Implementation

The registry data is checked for 'tracker' entry. If it is missing, this is an error.

```python
import dash_utils
from dash_utils import format_msg


def is_responsive(data):
    """Check fp 20 - responsiveness.
    If the ontology has an active issue tracker, PASS.

    Args:
        data (dict): ontology registry data from YAML file

    Return:
        PASS or ERROR with optional help message
    """
    if 'tracker' in data:
        tracker = data['tracker']
    else:
        tracker = None

    if tracker is None:
        return {'status': 'ERROR', 'comment': 'Missing tracker'}

    return {'status': 'PASS'}
```
