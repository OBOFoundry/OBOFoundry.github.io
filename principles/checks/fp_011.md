## [Locus of Authority](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-011-locus-of-authority.html) Automated Check

Discussion on this check can be [found here](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1007).

### Requirements
1. The ontology **must** have a single contact person

### Fixes
First, read the [FAQ](http://obofoundry.github.io/faq/how-do-i-edit-metadata.html) on how to edit the metadata for your ontology.

Next, determine who the point person for your ontology project is. This *must not* be a mailing list. If this person does not already have a GitHub account, we request that they [create one](https://github.com/join). Then, add the following to your [metadata file](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/tree/master/ontology) (replacing with the correct email, name, and GitHub username):
```
contact:
 email: foo@bar.com
 label: John Smith
 github: jsmith123
```

### Implementation
The registry data entry is validated with JSON schema using the [contact schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/master/util/schema/contact.json). The contact schema ensures that a contact entry is present and that the entry has a name and email address.

```python
import jsonschema

import dash_utils
from dash_utils import format_msg

contact_schema = dash_utils.load_schema('dependencies/contact.json')


def has_contact(data):
   """Check fp 11 - locus of authority.

   Check if the registry data contains a valid contract entry.

   Args:
       data (dict): ontology registry data from YAML file

   Return:
       PASS or ERROR with optional help message
   """
   try:
       jsonschema.validate(data, contact_schema)
   except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as ve:
       if 'contact' in data:
           # contact is in data but is not proper format
           return {'status': 'ERROR',
                   'comment': 'Invalid contact information'}
       else:
           # contact entry is missing from data
           return {'status': 'ERROR',
                   'comment': 'Missing contact information'}
   return {'status': 'PASS'}
```
