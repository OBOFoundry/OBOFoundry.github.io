## [Documented Plurality of Users](http://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-009-users.html) Automated Check

Discussion on this check can be [found here](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/1008).

### Requirements

1. The ontology **must** have a tracker.
2. The ontology **must** have usages.

### Fixes

First, read the [FAQ](http://obofoundry.github.io/faq/how-do-i-edit-metadata.html) on how to edit the metadata for your ontology.

#### Adding a Tracker

If you do not already have a version control repository that has an [Issues Tracker](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues), create one. We recommend creating a [GitHub Repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo). To do this, you will need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you do not already have one.

Once you have a version control repository, add the following to your [metadata file](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/tree/master/ontology) (replacing with the link to your repository's issue tracker):

```
tracker: https://github.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/issues
```

#### Adding Usages

Determine what other groups are using your ontology and how they are using it. Then, add the following to your [metadata file](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/tree/master/ontology) (replacing with the correct group name, link, and description):

```
usages:
- user: http://www.informatics.jax.org/disease (link to group)
  description: MGI disease model annotations use DO (description of group)
  examples:
   - url: http://www.informatics.jax.org/disease/DOID:4123 (link to specific example)
     description: Human genes and mouse homology associated with nail diseases (description of specific example)
```

You may have multiple examples for each user, and multiple users under the `usages` tag.

### Implementation

The registry data is checked for 'tracker' and 'usage' entries. If either is missing, this is an error.  The tracker should be a valid URL to an issue tracking system, and usages should contain at least one user with a valid URL and description.

```python
import dash_utils
from dash_utils import format_msg


def has_users(data):
   """Check fp 9 - users.
   If the ontology has an active issue tracker and examples of use, PASS.

   Args:
       data (dict): ontology registry data from YAML file

   Return:
       PASS or ERROR with optional help message
   """
   if 'tracker' in data:
       tracker = data['tracker']
   else:
       tracker = None
   if 'usages' in data:
       usages = data['usages']
       # TODO: usages should have a valid user that resovles
       #       and a description
   else:
       usages = None

   # tracker is required?
   if tracker is None and usages is None:
       return {'status': 'ERROR', 'comment': 'Missing tracker and usages'}
   elif tracker is None:
       return {'status': 'ERROR', 'comment': 'Missing tracker'}
   elif usages is None:
       return {'status': 'ERROR', 'comment': 'Missing usages'}
   return {'status': 'PASS'}
```
