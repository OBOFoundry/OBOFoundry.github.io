## "Plurality of Users" Automated Check

### Requirements
1. The ontology **must** have a tracker.
2. The ontology **must** have usages.

### Implementation
The registry data is checked for 'tracker' and 'usage' entries. If either is missing, this is an error.

```
import dash_utils
from dash_utils import format_msg


def has_users(data):
   """Check fp 9 - users.
   If the ontology has an active issue tracker and examples of use, PASS.

   Args:
       data (dict): ontology registry data from YAML file

   Return:
       PASS or ERROR with optional help message
   """
   if 'tracker' in data:
       tracker = data['tracker']
   else:
       tracker = None
   if 'usages' in data:
       usages = data['usages']
       # TODO: usages should have a valid user that resovles
       #       and a description
   else:
       usages = None

   # tracker is required?
   if tracker is None and usages is None:
       return format_msg('ERROR', ['missing tracker and usages'])
   elif tracker is None:
       return format_msg('ERROR', ['missing tracker'])
   elif usages is None:
       return format_msg('ERROR', ['missing usages'])
   return 'PASS'
```
