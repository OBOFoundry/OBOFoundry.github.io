## Summary

The ontology provider follows the recommendations and requirements outlined on the Ontology Standardization Guidelines page and the Project Management Guidelines page.

## Purpose

OBO Foundry ontologies commit to principles of ontology development designed to foster usability and usefulness, technical interoperability, and open communication. While these principles provide high-level guidance, there can be details of implementation that are equally important.
