## OBO

OBO is an anatomical ontology that represents body parts, organs
and tissues in a variety of animal species, with a focus on
vertebrates. It has been constructed to integrate seamlessly with
other ontologies, such as the OBO [Cell Ontology](http://cellontology.org), the [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org),
Trait and Phenotype ontologies, as well as [other anatomical ontologies](http://obofoundry.org).

The ontology includes comprehensive relationships to taxon-specific
anatomical ontologies, allowing integration of functional, phenotype
and expression data. The figure below shows taxon-centric anatomy
ontologies along the bottom axis; domain specific ontologies on the
right hand side; orthogonal ontologies on the left axis.

Currently OBO consists of over 13000 classes representing
structures that are shared across a variety of metazoans. As one of
the main uses of OBO is translational science, we have extensive
coverage of structures shared between humans and other
species. However, thanks to the involvement of many
[collaborators](/about/adopters.html), we have deep coverage of broad areas
of anatomy across diverse taxa.

We also make available an ontology called
[composite-metazoan](/downloads.html#multiont) which brings in subsets
of federated ontologies, with a total of over 40000 classes.
