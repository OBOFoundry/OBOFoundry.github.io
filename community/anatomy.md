Welcome to the OBO Foundry Anatomy Portal!

This community page organizes different OBO anatomy ontologies and
describes how they relate to one another.

## Upper level

The Common Anatomy Reference Ontology (CARO) provides an upper-level
structure that should be used as superclasses in OBO anatomy ontologies.

 * [caro](/ontology/caro.html)

## Subcellular

We take the term anatomy to include subcellular anatomy, which is
covered in GO.

 * [go](/ontology/go.html)

Note that some ontologies (WBbt, FBbt) include their own more specific subcellular components

## Cells

 * Plants: [po](/ontology/po.html)
 * Animals: [cl](/ontology/cl.html)

Note that some ontologies (PO, FBbt) include their own more specific cell types

## Gross anatomy

### Plants

The Plant Ontology (PO) covers all viridiplantae, and includes cell types as well as tissues/organs

 * [po](/ontology/po.html)

### Fungal

The Plant Ontology (PO) covers all multicellular fungi, and includes cell types as well as multi-cell structures

 * [fao](/ontology/fao.html)

### Slime Mold

 * [ddanat](/ontology/ddanat.html)

### Animals

Uberon is a multi-species anatom ontology covering metazoa
(animals). It can be used to bridge other species-specific animal
anatomy ontologies, see the documentation for details.

 * [uberon](/ontology/uberon.html)

Species or taxon-specific anatomy ontologies

 * Vertebrates
     * Vertebrate non-mammalian
        * [zfa](/ontology/zfa.html)
        * [xao](/ontology/xao.html)
     * Mammals
        * Mouse
           * [ma](/ontology/ma.html) (adult)
           * [emapa](/ontology/emapa.html) (all stages)
        * Human
           * [fma](/ontology/fma.html) (adult)
           * [ehdaa2](/ontology/ehdaa2.html) (embryo)
 * Non-vertebrate animals
     * model organism
        * [fbbt](/ontology/fbbt.html)
        * [wbbt](/ontology/wbbt.html)
        * [plana](/ontology/plana.html)
        * coming soon - echinoderm
     * non-model organism
        * Sponges: [poro](/ontology/poro.html)
        * Ctenophores: [cteno](/ontology/cteno.html)
        * Cephalopods: [ceph](/ontology/ceph.html)
