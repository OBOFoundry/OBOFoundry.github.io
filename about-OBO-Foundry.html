<h1>About the OBO Foundry</h1>

<p>The mission of the OBO Foundry is to develop a family of interoperable ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically accurate.
To achieve this, OBO Foundry participants follow and contribute to the development of an evolving set of <a href="/principles/fp-000-summary.html">principles</a>
including <a href="/principles/fp-001-open.html">open use</a>, <a href="/principles/fp-010-collaboration.html">collaborative development</a>, <a href="/principles/fp-005-delineated-content.html">non-overlapping and strictly-scoped content</a>, and common <a href="/principles/fp-002-format.html">syntax</a> and <a href="/principles/fp-007-relations.html">relations</a>,
based on ontology models that work well, such as the <a target="_new" href="http://geneontology.org/>Gene Ontology (GO)</a>.
       
<p>The OBO Foundry is overseen by an <a href="http://obofoundry.org/docs/OperationsCommittee.html">Operations Committee</a> with
<a href="/docs/EditorialWG.html">Editorial</a>, <a href="/docs/TechnicalWG.html">Technical</a> and <a href="/docs/OutreachWG.html">Outreach</a> working groups.</a>
