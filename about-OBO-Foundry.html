<h1>About the OBO Foundry</h1>

<p>
  The mission of the OBO Foundry is to develop a family of interoperable
  ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically accurate. To
  achieve this, OBO Foundry participants follow and contribute to the
  development of an evolving set of
  <a href="/principles/fp-000-summary.html">principles</a> including
  <a href="/principles/fp-001-open.html">open use</a>,
  <a href="/principles/fp-010-collaboration.html">collaborative development</a>,
  <a href="/principles/fp-005-delineated-content.html"
    >non-overlapping and strictly-scoped content</a
  >, and common <a href="/principles/fp-002-format.html">syntax</a> and
  <a href="/principles/fp-007-relations.html">relations</a>, based on ontology
  models that work well, such as the
  <a target="_new" href="http://geneontology.org/">Gene Ontology (GO)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The OBO Foundry is overseen by an
  <a href="http://obofoundry.org/docs/OperationsCommittee.html"
    >Operations Committee</a
  >
  with <a href="/docs/EditorialWG.html">Editorial</a>,
  <a href="/docs/TechnicalWG.html">Technical</a> and
  <a href="/docs/OutreachWG.html">Outreach</a> working groups.
