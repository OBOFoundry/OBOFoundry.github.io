  /*
  * This script simulates case-insensitivity by taking the given
  * URL, casting it to lower case, and then redirecting the user
  * to the lower-case-URL. This is a hack, as it's not currently
  * possible to enforce case-insensitivity on GitHub pages.
  *
  * In the worst case, this script may cause the 404 page to be
  * loaded twice. Suppose a user went to homepage/NonExistent.html,
  * leading them to this page; this script would redirect them to
  * homepage/nonexistent.html which would again lead to this page.
