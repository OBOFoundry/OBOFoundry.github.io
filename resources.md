## Ontology Browsers

- [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/)
- [BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/): has over 700 biomedical ontologies, including the OBO Foundry ontologies. Users can search for terms or browse individual ontologies. BioPortal also provides tools to aid in increasing ontology interoperability.
- [Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index): lets users search for terms across all ontologies, or individual ontologies, as well as view term hierarchies. OLS also has an API so that ontologies can be browsed programmatically.
- [Ontobee](https://ontobee.org/): Part of the Onto-Animal tool collection. Users can search all available ontologies and browse detailed descriptions of individiual terms. OntoBee is the default server for most OBO Foundry ontology IRIs.
- [AberOWL](http://aber-owl.net/): A repository of biological ontologies and access to reasoned versions of those ontologies. Ontolgies can be browsed by term labels or queried by Manchester OWL syntax statements.
- [QuickGO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/)
- [AmiGO](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo)
- [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/)

## Tutorials

- [**OBO Ontology Training**](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/): lessons and tutorials aimed at database curators, ontology curators, ontology engineers/developers, and (semantic) software engineers.

## Ontology Tools

- [Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit): A toolkit for initializing a new ontology repository. The template includes a structured directory, a Makefile with automated release workflows, continuous integration testing, and full documentation.
- [ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/): A command line tool to automate ontology workflows. It includes commands that can be used manually or integrated in automated processes to develop and release ontologies.
- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/): An ontology editing environment for OWL ontologies. It allows developers to visualize the ontology hierarchy, add and edit ontology terms, reason over the ontology, and more.
- [Onto-Animals](http://www.hegroup.org/ontozoo/): Tools to extract external ontology terms, compare ontologies, edit ontology terms, query and visualize ontologies, and more.
- [VOCOL](https://vocol.iais.fraunhofer.de/): An integrated environment for collaborative vocabulary development
- [Karma Data Integration](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/karma/): A data integration tool
- [Ontofox](http://ontofox.hegroup.org/): An ontology term and relation extraction and reuse tool
- [Ubergraph](https://github.com/INCATools/ubergraph): A sparql endpoint with many OBO ontologies loaded and pre-reasoned with simple triples materialized

## Ontology Analysis

- [OBO Dashboard](https://dashboard.obofoundry.org): An assesment of OBO Foundry ontologies' conformance to OBO Foundry principles
- [OBO Community Health Report](https://cthoyt.com/obo-community-health): A self-updating assessment of the quality of metadata, responsiveness of the maintainers, and the overall community engagement for each OBO Foundry ontology.
- [Ontology Quality Assessment](https://cthoyt.com/oquat): A self-updating assesment of the semantic quality of OBO Foundry ontologies and beyond (using known prefixes, using standard identifiers, etc.)
