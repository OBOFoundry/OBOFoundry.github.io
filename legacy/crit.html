	<p>
	  OBO is an open community and, by joining the initiative, the
	  authors of an ontology commit to its maintenance in light of
	  scientific advance and to working with other members to
	  ensure the improvement of these principles over time. The
	  OBO Foundry is an attempt to apply the scientific method to
	  the task of ontology development, and the scientific method
	  rests on constant criticism and on the assumption that no
	  resource will ever exist in a form in which it cannot be
	  further improved.
