      <p>The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry is a collective of ontology developers that are committed to collaboration and adherence to shared principles. The mission of the OBO Foundry is to develop a family of interoperable ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically accurate. To achieve this, OBO Foundry participants voluntarily adhere to and contribute to the development of an evolving set of principles including <a href="/principles/fp-001-open.html">open use</a>, <a href="/principles/fp-010-collaboration.html">collaborative development</a>, <a href="/principles/fp-005-delineated-content.html">non-overlapping and strictly-scoped content</a>, and common <a href="/principles/fp-002-format.html">syntax</a> and <a href="/principles/fp-007-relations.html">relations</a>, based on ontology models that work well, such as the Gene Ontology (GO).</p>
      <p>The OBO Foundry is overseen by an Operations Committee with <a href="/docs/EditorialWG.html">Editorial</a>, <a href="/docs/TechnicalWG.html">Technical</a> and <a href="/docs/OutreachWG.html">Outreach</a> working groups. The processes of the Editorial working group are modelled on the journal refereeing process. A complete treatment of the OBO Foundry is given in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2814061/">&quot;The OBO Foundry: coordinated evolution of ontologies to support biomedical data integration&quot;</a>.</p>
      <p>On this site you will find a table of ontologies, available in several formats, with details for each, and documentation on <a href="/principles/fp-000-summary.html">OBO Principles</a>.</p>
