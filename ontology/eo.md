A structured, controlled vocabulary for the representation of plant environmental conditions.

## Migration Guide from EO to PECO

If you are using classes like EO:nnnnnn then you should be able to substitute this for PECO:nnnnnn, as all of the numeric parts of the ID are preserved.

For a more robust mechanism, peco.obo contains alt_ids, and peco.owl contains the equivalent replaced_by assertions, which point from an obsoleted EO class to the corresponding PECO class.

If you have any issues you can report them here:
