    description: PennTURBO accelerates the processes of finding and connecting key information from clinical records, via semantic modeling of the processes that generated the data. This makes the discovery of previously unappreciated relations between the data possible for research and for operational tasks.

    description: The Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO) describes types of scientific evidence within the biological research domain. ECO uses OBI to logically describe how the evidence arises from an investigation.
