Creating a comprehensive classification of human diseases organized by etiology.

<u>Additional OBO formatted DO files</u>
- Download DO's asserted is_a OBO file [HumanDO.obo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/master/src/ontology/HumanDO.obo). 
This file is equivalent to doid-non-classified.obo.

- DO provides an additional OBO file, [doid-merged.obo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiseaseOntology/HumanDiseaseOntology/master/src/ontology/doid-merged.obo). 
 for the [AGR](http://www.alliancegenome.org) that includes [OMIM](http://omim.org) to DO associations as xrefs plus defined  relationships between OMIM susceptibility IDs and DO terms.
