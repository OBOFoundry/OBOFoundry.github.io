The Oral Health and Disease Ontology is intended as a BFO and OBO
Foundry compliant ontology for the oral health domain. It is currently
used to represent the content of dental practice health records and is
intended to be further developed for use in translation medicine.  It
demonstrates a principled split between billing codes as information
entities and what the codes are about, such as dental procedures,
materials, and patients.

OHD is structured using BFO uses terms from OGMS, OBI, IAO and FMA. In
addition it uses terms from CARO, OMRSE, NCBITaxon, and a subset of
terms from the Current Dental Terminology (CDT)

OHD is in early development and subject to change without notice. 

The current developers of OHD are Alan Ruttenberg(alanruttenberg@gmail.com) and Bill Duncan
(wdduncan@gmail.com)

Initial work on OHD was funded by the University of Buffalo School of
Dental Medicine and NIDCR grants 5R21DE021178-02 and 5R03DE023358-02,
