This ontology is intended to be used for the description and curation of information related to gene regulatory processes in echinoderms (e.g., expression patterns of endogenous genes and reporter DNA constructs, phenotypic effects of gene perturbations, etc.). 
The ontology was developed as a collaborativie work between MARIMBA (http://marimba.obs-vlfr.fr/home), a database of marine invertebrate models genomics created in the context of the European project CORBEL (https://www.corbel-project.eu/home.html) and Echinobase (http://www.echinobase.org/Echinobase/), a database of echinoderm genomics. 
The ontology will be used in both MARIMBA and Echinobase.
