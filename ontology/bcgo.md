The Beta Cell Genomics Ontology (BCGO) is an application ontology built for the beta cell genomics studies aiming to support database annotation, complicated semantic queries, and automated cell type classification.

The BCGO was developed for supporting beta cell genomics database (http://www.betacell.org) that are no longer in operation.
