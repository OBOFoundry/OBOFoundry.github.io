The Common Anatomy Reference Ontology (CARO) is being developed to facilitate interoperability between existing anatomy ontologies for different species, and will provide a template for building new anatomy ontologies. CARO will be described in Anatomy Ontologies for Bioinformatics: Principles and Practice Albert Burger, Duncan Davidson and Richard Baldock (Editors).

**Important note**: CARO has been _obsoleted_ in favour of Uberon.
However, not all CARO terms have been migrated to Uberon; please request any terms you were using from CARO and are missing from Uberon on the Uberon issue tracker: https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues.
