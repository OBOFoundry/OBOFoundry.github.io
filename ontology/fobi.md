FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a ”Food Ontology” consisting of raw foods and multi-ingredient foods while the second is a ”Biomarker Ontology” containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties.
