An ontology is a computational representation of a domain of knowledge based upon a controlled, standardized vocabulary for describing entities and the semantic relationships between them.

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) aims to provide a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease. Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality, such as atrial septal defect. The HPO is currently being developed using the medical literature, Orphanet, DECIPHER, and OMIM.

The HPO can be browsed using:

 * [Main Browser](https://hpo.jax.org/)
 * [Monarch Browser](https://monarchinitiative.org/phenotype/HP:0000118)
