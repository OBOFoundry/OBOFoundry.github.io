TODO for this ontology to become "active":

1. Needs public issue tracker (required by metadata schema checks). For example,
   this could be done via github even if the ontology is not maitained there, as
   ChEBI and PR do.
2. Ontology needs to be distributed in RDF/XML as mandated
   by https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-002-format.html
