ICEO is a community-driven ontology to represent, standardize, and integrate bacterial integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and to support computer-assisted reasoning.

The integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are modular mobile genetic elements that are integrated into a host genome and are passively propagated during chromosomal replication and cell division. We generated an ICE database called ICEberg (http://db-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEberg/). The ICEO is developed to first systematically represent the ICE information collected in the database. The ICEO will also be further used to enhance the ICEberg and support various applications.
