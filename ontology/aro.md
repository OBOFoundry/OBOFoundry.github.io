The Antibiotic Resistance Ontology
describes antibiotic resistance genes and mutations,
their products, mechanisms, and associated phenotypes,
as well as antibiotics and their molecular targets.
It is integrated with the [Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database](https://card.mcmaster.ca),
a curated resource containing high quality reference data
on the molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance.
