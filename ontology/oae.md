The Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE) is a biomedical ontology in the domain of adverse events. OAE aims to standardize adverse event annotation, integrate various adverse event data, and support computer-assisted reasoning.  OAE is a community-based ontology. Its development follows the OBO Foundry principles.
