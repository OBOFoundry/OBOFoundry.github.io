The Social Insect Behavior Ontology (SIBO), created by Chris Smith of the BDGP/SFSU. It was been adopted by Chris Mungall, but I am currently looking to hand it over or to merge it into the <a href="nbo.html">NBO</a>

Mostly this is collected terms for Chemical, Anatomy, Behavior, Species. The most developed use cases are for Pogonomyrmex harvester ant foraging and apis mellifera honeybee colony defense.
