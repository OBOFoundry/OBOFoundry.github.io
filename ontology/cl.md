The Cell Ontology is designed as a structured controlled vocabulary for cell types. This ontology was constructed for use by the model organism and other bioinformatics databases, where there is a need for a controlled vocabulary of cell types. This ontology is not organism specific. It covers cell types from prokaryotes to mammals. However, it excludes plant cell types, which are covered by PO.

## Integration with other ontologies

Cell types in CL are linked to [uberon](uberon.html) via part-of
relationships. The cl.owl product imports a subset of the entire
uberon ontology. To see all cell types in the context of all
anatomical structures, use the uberon ext release.

Cell types are linked to [GO](go.html) biological processes via the
capable-of relationship type. CL also links to other ontologies such
as [chebi](chebi.html), [pr](pr.html) and [pato](pato.html).

In turn, CL is linked to from a variety of ontologies such as GO,
Uberon and various phenotype ontologies.
