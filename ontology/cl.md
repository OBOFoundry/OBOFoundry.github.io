Cell Ontology (CL) is an ontology designed to classify and describe cell types across different organisms. 
It serves as a resource for model organism and bioinformatics databases. 
The ontology covers a broad range of cell types in animal cells, with over 2700 cell type classes, 
and provides high-level cell type classes as mapping points for cell type classes in ontologies 
representing other species, such as the Plant Ontology or Drosophila Anatomy Ontology. 
Integration with other ontologies such as Uberon, GO, CHEBI, PR, and PATO enables linking cell types to anatomical structures, biological processes, and other relevant concepts. 

The Cell Ontology was created in 2004 and has been a core OBO Foundry ontology since the start of the Foundry. 
Since then, CL has been adopted by various efforts,  including the HuBMAP project, Human Cell Atlas (HCA), 
cellxgene platform, Single Cell Expression Atlas, BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), 
ArrayExpress, The Cell Image Library, ENCODE, and FANTOM5, for annotating cell types and 
facilitating cellular reference mapping, as documented through various publications and examples.

## Integration with other ontologies

Cell types in CL are linked to [uberon](uberon.html) via part-of
relationships. The cl.owl product imports a subset of the entire
uberon ontology. To see all cell types in the context of all
anatomical structures, use the uberon ext release.

Cell types are linked to [GO](go.html) biological processes via the
capable-of relationship type. CL also links to other ontologies such
as [chebi](chebi.html), [pr](pr.html) and [pato](pato.html).

In turn, CL is linked to from a variety of ontologies such as GO,
Uberon and various phenotype ontologies.
