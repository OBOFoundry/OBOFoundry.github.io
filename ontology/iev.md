A structured controlled vocabulary of pathway centric biological processes. This ontology is a INOH pathway annotation ontology, one of a set of ontologies intended to be used in pathway data annotation to ease data integration. This ontology is used to annotate biological processes, pathways, sub-pathways in the INOH pathway data.<br>INOH is part of the BioPAX working group.
