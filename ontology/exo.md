Significant progress has been made over the last several years in collecting and improving access to genomic, toxicology, and health data to promote understanding about environmental influences on human health.  The resulting information resources, however, lack extensive and reliable exposure data, which are required to translate molecular insights, elucidate environmental contributions to diseases, and assess human health risks at the individual and population levels.  We report our development of an Exposure Ontology, ExO, designed to address this information gap by facilitating centralization and integration of exposure data to inform understanding of environmental health. Like other widely used ontologies, ExO is intended to bridge the gap between exposure science and diverse environmental health disciplines including toxicology, epidemiology, disease surveillance, and epigenetics
