The Performance Summary Display Ontology (PSDO) is a lightweight application ontology used to
reproducibly study visualizations of clinical performance and their associated outcomes in 
healthcare quality improvement settings. 
PSDO extends boundaries of visual representation artifacts by the IAO in the domain of distributed
representations. 
PSDO describes dimensional representations of relational information displays that can be used to
study the influence of feedback interventions on clinical practice.
