CVDO is an ontology based on the OGMS model of disease, designed to describe entities related to cardiovascular diseases (including the diseases themselves, the underlying disorders, and the related pathological processes). It is being developed at Sherbrooke University (Canada) and the INSERM research institute (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale).
