The PRotein Ontology (PRO) formally defines taxon-specific and taxon-neutral protein-related entities in three major areas: proteins related by evolution; proteins produced from a given gene; and protein-containing complexes.

You are free to share (copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format) and adapt (remix, transform, and build upon the material) for any purpose, even commercially.

You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
