title: STATistics Ontology 
description: STATO is a general-purpose STATistics Ontology. Its aim is to provide coverage for processes such as statistical tests, their conditions of application, and information needed or resulting from statistical methods, such as probability distributions, variables, spread and variation metrics. STATO also covers aspects of experimental design and description of plots and graphical representations commonly used to provide visual cues of data distribution or layout and to assist review of the results.

The STATistics Ontology (STATO) project started in early 2012, as part of the requirement of the community-driven ISA Commons to represent the results of data analysis. STATO is a standalone project since Nov 2012. STATO is driven and funded by several ISA-based projects and their user community, but also by collaborations with data publication platforms. STATO is applicable to, but not limited, the broad life, natural and biomedical science domain with documented applications for factorial design, association studies, differential expression, hit selection and meta-analysis. STATO has been developed to interoperate with other OBO Foundry ontologies, hence relies on the Basics Formal Ontology (BFO) as a top level ontology and uses the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) as mid-level ontology.
