title: Ontology of Host Pathogen Interactions
description: OHPI is a community-driven ontology of host-pathogen interactions (OHPI) and represents the virulence factors (VFs) and how the mutants of VFs in the Victors database become less virulence inside a host organism or host cells. It is developed to represent manually curated HPI knowledge available in the PHIDIAS resource.

# OHPI: Ontology of Host-Pathogen Interactions

OHPI is a community-driven ontology of host-pathogen interactions (OHPI) and represents the virulence factors (VFs) and how the mutants of VFs in the [Victors](http://www.phidias.us/victors/index.php) database become less virulence inside a host organism or host cells. It is developed to represent manually curated HPI knowledge available in the [PHIDIAS](http://www.phidias.us) resource.

**Example:** The OHPI object property ‘gene mutant attenuated in host cell’ represents a relation between a gene and a host cell where the microbial mutant lacking the gene is attenuated in the host cell compared to the wild type microbe. Such an object property can be used to represent a virulence factor and its interaction in a host cell, e.g., the ugpB gene of *Brucella spp.* and human epithelial cell line HeLa cell line where the ugpB mutant of *Brucella spp.* is attenuated in HeLa cells.
