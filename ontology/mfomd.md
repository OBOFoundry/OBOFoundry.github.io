An ontology to describe and classify mental diseases such as schizophrenia, annotated with DSM-IV and ICD codes where applicable.

Historic note: The IDs used in this ontology all have the `MFOMD`, as this ontology was originally conceived as part of [mf](mf.html), but the official title for this ontology is the "Mental Disease Ontology"
