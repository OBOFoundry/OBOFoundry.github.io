The Teleost taxonomy ontology is being used to facilitate annotation of phenotypes, particularly for taxa that are not covered by NCBI because no submissions of molecular data have been made. Taxonomy ontologies can also be valuable in annotating legacy data, where authors make phenotype or ecological assertions (e.g., host-parasite associations) that refer to groups that are reorganized or no longer recognized. The taxonomy ontology serves as the source of taxa for our project's use for identifying evolutionary changes that match the phenotype of a zebrafish mutant.
