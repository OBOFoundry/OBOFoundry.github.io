domain: investigations
purpose: 'This ontology is developed to represent omics contextual data to support experts in specimen-derivative data  discovery and reuse stages.'
scope: 'This ontology includes real-world physical objects such as specimens, computerized objects such as datasets, and planned processes and related specifications'
intended users: 'The intended end-users are biobanking organizations, data collectors, omics researchers, and decision-makers.'
commitment to collaboration: 'new terms introduced by NGBO will be submitted to appropriate OBO foundry domain ontology when possible. NGBO also, accept and review requests from community to edit/add terms through issue requests here (https://github.com/Dalalghamdi/NGBO/issues)'
