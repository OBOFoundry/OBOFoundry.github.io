The Amphioxus Development and Anatomy Ontology (AMPHX) is to describe the anatomy and development of Amphioxus, also known as lancelet, member of the invertebrate subphylum Cephalochordata and the phylum Chordata. This ontology is intended to be used for description of gene expression in amphioxus (e.g. Insitus, RNA-seq). The ontology was created in the context of the European project [CORBEL](https://www.corbel-project.eu/home.html), and used in the database [MARIMBA](http://marimba.obs-vlfr.fr/home).
