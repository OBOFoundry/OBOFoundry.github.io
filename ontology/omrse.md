For more information on the social entities represented in OMRSE, please visit our wiki page or list of publications. OMRSE is designed to be a mid-level ontology that bridges the gap between BFO, which it reuses for its top-level hierarchy, and more specific domain or application ontologies. For this reason, we are always open to working with ontology developers who want to build interoperability between their projects and OMRSE.
