Model card reports are documents that describe specific details about machine learning models to promote transparency - intended use cases, limitations, trained data sets, performance metrics, etc. The Model Card Report Ontology (MCRO) represents the common structures of this document to provide a computable and linkable artifact towards aggregation and archiving model card reports.
