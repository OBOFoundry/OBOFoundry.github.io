ONS was developed under the ENPADASI European project, to assist the standardized description of (human) nutritional studies. As such, it includes and covers classes and relations that are commonly encountered while conducting, storing, harmonizing, integrating, describing and querying for nutritional studies. ONS main objective and long-term goal, is to represent a comprehensive resource for the description of concepts in the broader human nutrition domain, representing a solid and extensible formal ontology framework, where integration of new information can be easily achieved by the addition of extra modules.
