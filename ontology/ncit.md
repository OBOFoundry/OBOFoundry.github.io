The NCI Thesaurus is a reference terminology that includes broad
coverage of the cancer domain, including cancer related diseases,
findings and abnormalities; anatomy; agents, drugs and chemicals;
genes and gene products and so on. In certain areas, like cancer
diseases and combination chemotherapies, it provides the most granular
and consistent terminology available. It combines terminology from
numerous cancer research related domains, and provides a way to
integrate or link these kinds of information together through semantic
relationships.

The Thesaurus currently contains over 34,000 concepts, structured into
20 taxonomic trees. The NCI Thesaurus provides concept history tables
to record changes in the vocabulary over time as the science
changes. Within NCI, the Thesaurus is used to provide terminology
support to the Institutes public Web portal, <a
href="http://cancer.gov/">http://cancer.gov</a>, numerous portals
supporting consortia and other communities of researchers, and is used
in the caCORE as the semantic base for metadata and objects that form
the infrastructure upon which the NCICB portals are built (see <a
href="http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/">http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov</a>).

Enterprise Vocabulary Services group of the Center for Biomedical 
Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Maryland,
