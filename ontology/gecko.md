Genomics Cohorts Knowledge Ontology (GECKO) is an ontology to represent genomics cohort attributes. The GECKO is maintained by the [CINECA project]( https://www.cineca-project.eu), and standardises attributes commonly used for genomics cohort description as well as individual-level data items. A series of tools is being developed to enable automated generation of harmonised data files based on a JSON schema mapping file. For more information please contact [CINECA](mailto:info@cineca-project.eu).
