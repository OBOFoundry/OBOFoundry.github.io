Concepts, definitions, terms, and resources for standardized description of a microarray experiment in support of MAGE v.1. The MGED ontology is divided into the MGED Core ontology which is intended to be stable and in synch with MAGE v.1; and the MGED Extended ontology which adds further associations and classes not found in MAGE v.1.
