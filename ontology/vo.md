\The Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a biomedical ontology in the domain of vaccine and vaccination. VO aims to standardize vaccine annotation, integrate various vaccine data, and support computer-assisted reasoning.  VO supports basic vaccine R&D and clincal vaccine usage. VO is initiated and primarily developed by Dr. Yongqun "Oliver" He at the University of Michigan Medical School. VO is being developed as a community-based ontology with support and collaborations from the vaccine and bio-ontology communities.
