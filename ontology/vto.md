The Vertebrate Taxonomy Ontology includes both extinct and extant vertebrates, aiming to provide one comprehensive hierarchy. The hierarchy backbone for extant taxa is based on the NCBI taxonomy. Since the NCBI taxonomy only includes species associated with archived genetic data, to complement this, we also incorporate taxonomic information across the vertebrates from the Paleobiology Database (PaleoDB). The Teleost Taxonomy Ontology (TTO) and AmphibiaWeb (AWeb) are incorporated to provide a more authoritative hierarchy and a richer set of names for specific taxonomic groups.
