## How should I manage and curate my ontology throughout its lifecycle?

The [OBOOK (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Organized Knowledge)](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/) is a useful reference for creating and working with ontologies.
In particular, the [Ontology Curator Pathway section](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/pathways/ontology-curator/) describes in detail two major approaches to
curating an ontology and managing it throughout its life cycle, with descriptions of best practices and tools to help you with the process.
Tools covered in this guide include git, GitHub, ROBOT (a command-line tool for working with ontologies) and the Ontology Development Kit (ODK).
