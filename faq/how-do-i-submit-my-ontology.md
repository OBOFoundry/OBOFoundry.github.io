## How do I submit my ontology?

To submit a new ontology for inclusion in the OBO Foundry, you will need to:
1. Review the expectations and requirements for membership [here](http://obofoundry.org/docs/OBO_Foundry_membership_requirements_and_technical_details.html).
2. Submit your request to our GitHub tracker, using the [New Ontology Request template](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+ontology&template=new-ontology-request.md&title=). _Note: please see the [New Ontology Regisration Instructions](http://obofoundry.org/docs/NewOntologyRegistrationInstructions.html) for guidance._

Please see [this guide](/docs/OBO_Foundry_membership_requirements_and_technical_details.html) for detailed instructions and background.
