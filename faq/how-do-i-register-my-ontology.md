## How do I submit my ontology?

To submit a new ontology for inclusion in the OBO Foundry, you will need to:

1. Review the [OBO Foundry requirements and technical details](https://obofoundry.org/docs/Policy_for_OBO_namespace_and_associated_PURL_requests.html) document for membership expectations and submission instructions.
2. Submit your request to our GitHub tracker, using the [New Ontology Request template](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+ontology&template=new-ontology-request.md&title=). _Note: please see the [New Ontology Registration Instructions](http://obofoundry.org/docs/NewOntologyRegistrationInstructions.html) for guidance._
3. Send an email to [obo-discuss](mailto:obo-discuss@googlegroups.com) with your request to allow community feedback (you may need to [apply to join group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/obo-discuss) first.) Be sure to include the link to the issue you created in step 2.
4. (_Optional_): If you would like to join the obo-community Slack, please indicate this in your email.
