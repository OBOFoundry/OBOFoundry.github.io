## How do I modify the OBO Foundry website

This FAQ entry is primarily for the benefit of the internal OBO
operation group, but we welcome improvements in the site from anyone.

Anyone is free to suggest changes of any nature on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBOFoundry.github.io/issues)

Note that many pages on the website are editable - look for the "Edit"
button. Note that if you are not part of the OBO team on github, you
will have to submit a Pull Request for you changes to be accepted. See
[how-do-i-edit-metadata entry in the FAQ](how-do-i-edit-metadata.html)
for more details.

If you want to make bigger changes to the website then we recommend
you check out the project from GitHub (after forking, if you are not
om the OBO team). You can then run the site locally (Ruby/Jekyll is
required) and test changes locally.
